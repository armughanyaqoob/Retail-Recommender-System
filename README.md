# Retail Recommender System Project

This project includes three main scripts for the development of a Retail Recommender System.

## Files Overview:

### 1. `RetailAnalysisApp.py`

This script initializes a Retail Analysis application using PySpark. It includes functionalities for data loading, exploration, and basic visualization using Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

### 2. `RetailFeatureImportanceAnalysis.py`

This script focuses on analyzing and visualizing feature importance in a retail dataset using LightGBM. It covers data loading, preprocessing, and training a LightGBM model for feature importance.

### 3. `recommendation_system.py`

This script implements a retail recommender system. It covers content-based recommendation using TF-IDF for product descriptions and collaborative filtering using deep learning techniques with an autoencoder model.

## Prerequisites:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python Libraries (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, LightGBM, TensorFlow, PySpark, etc.)

## Usage:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Execute individual scripts based on your requirements.

Feel free to explore each file for more detailed explanations and customization options.
